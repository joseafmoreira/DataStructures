/**
 * A network is a non-linear abstract data type that, like the graph, consists
 * of vertexes and edges or connections between those vertexes.
 * <p>
 * There will be two base types of network implemented:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Undirected</li>
 * <li>Directed</li>
 * </ul>
 * The difference between undirected and directed networks is that if an edge is
 * added between two vertexes
 * it will be bidirectional and unidirectional, respectively.
 * <p>
 * For this network implementation, the edges have weights associated to them.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The common operations for a network include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #addEdge(Object, Object, double)}: Adds an edge between two
 * vertexes with a specified weight</li>
 * <li>{@link #shortestPathWeight(Object, Object)}: Returns the weight of the
 * shortest path between two vertexes</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This interface is a member of the
 * <i>Data Structures Framework</i>
 * 
 * <h3>NetworkADT</h3>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of elements in this network
 * @since 1.0
 * @version 1.0
